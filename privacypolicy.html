                <h5>Request Access</h5>
                <p>To your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to
                    receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing
                    it.</p>

                <h5>Request Correction</h5>
                <p>Of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
                    data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you
                    provide to us.</p>

                <h5>Request Erasure</h5>
                <p>Of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no
                    good reason for us continuing to process it.</p>

                <h5>Object to Processing</h5>
                <p>Of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
                    there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on
                    this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

                <h5>Request Restriction of Processing</h5>
                <p>Of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in
                    certain scenarios.</p>

                <h5>Request the Transfer</h5>
                <p>Of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
                    chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p>

                <h5>Right to Withdraw Consent</h5>
                <p>At any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not
                    affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.</p>
